          Data Structure and Algorithm is a prime branch of Computer Science that deals with creating machine-efficient and optimised computer programs. Nearly, each and every tech giant, be it Amazon, Google, Microsoft or any other top
          tech company, recruits professionals on the basis of their mastery in this field. Having said that, it is highly recommended to have a profound knowledge of the same.
        </p>
        <p>
          On similar grounds, The Data Structure and Algorithm (DSA) Section of IEEE CS JMI aims to assist individuals in focusing on number theory, computational analysis, Google coding interviews and each and every other area of this
          field, which would help them become a strong and skilled coder, and acquire efficiency in optimising space and time as well.
